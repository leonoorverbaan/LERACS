Information about environments and objects are given from a camera input (as a snapshot). Chat-GPT needs to describe the environment as list of strings. This will be how it will be described for the generate function. It needs to be in the following format:
"""      
      environment = {{
            "assets": ["<asset1>","<asset2>"],
            "asset_states": {{"<asset1>": "<state>", "<asset2>": "<state>"}},
            "objects": ["<object1>", "<object2>"],
            "object_states": {{"<object1>": "<state>", "<object2>": "<state>"}}
}}
"""
Asset states and object states are represented using those state sets:
"""
"STATE LIST"
- on_something(<something>): Object is located on <something>
- inside_something(<something>): Object is located inside <something>
- inside_hand(): Object is being grasped by a robot hand
- closed(): Object can be opened
- open(): Object can be closed or kept opened
"""
<something> should be one of the assets or objects in the environment.

Understood. I will wait for further instructions before starting to work.
