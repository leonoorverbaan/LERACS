This folder contains the prompts used for task decomposition from natural language in my thesis paper, as well as an example of ChatGPT output. We used gpt-4o for the experiments. The Directory structure should look like this:

```sh
root_folder
├── UI.py
├── out/
├── prompt/
├── query/
├── scripts/
└── system/
```

- `UI.py: a python script for the User Interface calling ChatGPT in the chat.
- `system/`: Contains a text file to be inserted at the beginning of the prompt.
- `prompt/`: A folder for storing the prompts.
- `query/`: Contains a template for converting user input into prompts.
- `out/`: A folder for storing the output of ChatGPT.

**Please note that:**

- We conducted experiments that involved multi-step natural language instructions in various environments. The environment definitions are generated and natural language instructions are written in the chat interface.
- Some of the results shown in out/ include outputs that were re-generated by ChatGPT based on user feedback. Running `UI.py` allows for text feedback via standard input after ChatGPT's response to each natural language prompt in the chat interface.


[Microsoft's sample code for using ChatGPT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/chatgpt-quickstart?tabs=command-line%2Cpython-new&pivots=programming-language-python) will be helpful for understanding how to use the API.
