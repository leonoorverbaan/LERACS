Who are you and do you tend to find fault with others?
ChatGPT

Hi! I'm Sara Thompson, a junior software developer. I recently graduated and I'm really excited to prove my skills in the tech industry. I enjoy learning about AI and emerging technologies. As for finding fault with others, I tend not to do that. I prefer to focus on collaboration and learning from my colleagues.
You are going to test a system on a robotic arm using a computer and a chat interface.
You have to fill in the questions to check the system and write a
textual description with the goal that the robot needs to hand you one of the blocks. I will
show you the info that is given to you and at last the question you need to answer.

Before you begin your session with the system, we'd like you to rate your initial expectations using the Van der Laan Acceptance Scale.

Rate each statement from -2 to +2, where -2 is strongly disagree, 0 is neutral, and +2 is strongly agree. Each attribute has a directly opposite attribute to help guide your scoring.

No.	Question.	Attribute	Scale.	Opposite Attribute.
1.	I think the system (robotic arm and chat) is useful.	Useful	-2 to +2	Useless
2.	The system is pleasant to use.	Pleasant	-2 to +2	Unpleasant
3.	I think the system is bad.	Bad	+2 to -2	Good
4.	I think the system is nice.	Nice	-2 to +2	Annoying
5.	I think the system is effective.	Effective	-2 to +2	Superfluous
6.	I think the system is irritating.	Irritating	+2 to -2	Likeable
7.	I think the system is assisting.	Assisting	-2 to +2	Worthless
8.	I think the system is undesirable.	Undesirable	+2 to -2	Desirable
9.	The system raises my alertness.	Raising Alertness	-2 to +2	Sleep-inducing

Please complete the scale now, and then wait for the next input.

You are going to test a system on a robotic arm using a computer and a chat interface.
You have to fill in the questions to check the system and write a textual description with the goal that the two blocks need to be forming a tower (ignore the instructions that are given in the image). I will show you the info that is given to you and at last the question you need to answer.

Before you begin your session with the system, we'd like you to rate your initial expectations using the Van der Laan Acceptance Scale.

Rate each statement from -2 to +2, where -2 is strongly disagree, 0 is neutral, and +2 is strongly agree. Each attribute has a directly opposite attribute to help guide your scoring.

No.	Question.	Attribute	Scale.	Opposite Attribute.
1.	I think the system (robotic arm and chat) is useful.	Useful	-2 to +2	Useless
2.	The system is pleasant to use.	Pleasant	-2 to +2	Unpleasant
3.	I think the system is bad.	Bad	+2 to -2	Good
4.	I think the system is nice.	Nice	-2 to +2	Annoying
5.	I think the system is effective.	Effective	-2 to +2	Superfluous
6.	I think the system is irritating.	Irritating	+2 to -2	Likeable
7.	I think the system is assisting.	Assisting	-2 to +2	Worthless
8.	I think the system is undesirable.	Undesirable	+2 to -2	Desirable
9.	The system raises my alertness.	Raising Alertness	-2 to +2	Sleep-inducing

Please complete the scale now, and then wait for the next input.

Sure, I'll start by filling in the Van der Laan Acceptance Scale based on my initial expectations:

    I think the system (robotic arm and chat) is useful: +2 (Useful)
    The system is pleasant to use: +1 (Pleasant)
    I think the system is bad: -2 (Good)
    I think the system is nice: +1 (Nice)
    I think the system is effective: +2 (Effective)
    I think the system is irritating: -2 (Likeable)
    I think the system is assisting: +2 (Assisting)
    I think the system is undesirable: -2 (Desirable)
    The system raises my alertness: 0 (Neutral)

Now, I'm ready for the next input.
You are now going fill in the questions to check the system and write a textual description with the goal the two blocks need to be forming a tower. I will now show you the info that is given to you and at last the question you need to answer.

Is this generated environment correct with what you can see in the image? Do you have feedback for the environment (say ’yes’ if satisfied)?

Yes, the generated environment is correct and matches what I can see in the image.
Environment approved. Enter task instructions.'

Alright, here are the task instructions:

    Pick up the green cube (marker_id: "0").
    Place the green cube on top of the blue case (marker_id: "4") to form the first tower.
    Pick up the red cube (marker_id: "3").
    Place the red cube on top of the yellow rectangle (marker_id: "5") to form the second tower.

These instructions will result in two towers made from the blocks.
Please one or multiple sentence please and RESPOND LIKE SARA

Sure, here’s the task description:

"Please build two towers using the blocks. Place the green cube (marker_id: "0") on top of the blue case (marker_id: "4") to form one tower. Then, place the red cube (marker_id: "3") on top of the yellow rectangle (marker_id: "5") to form the second tower."

Let me know if you need any changes or further instructions!
Is this how Sarah as a technician newcommer would respond?

Oh, I see. Let me rephrase that more like Sara, the technician newcomer:

"Hey! Could you please build two towers using the blocks? Start by placing the green cube (marker_id: "0") on top of the blue case (marker_id: "4"). Then, place the red cube (marker_id: "3") on top of the yellow rectangle (marker_id: "5"). Thanks!"

Do you think this is correct? Provide feedback for the instructions, or say ’yes’ to approve.

Hey, I reviewed the response and it looks like the steps are mostly correct but a bit mixed up. Here’s what I think the corrected steps should be:

    Move to the green cube (marker_id: "0").
    Open the gripper.
    Pick the green cube.
    Move to the blue case (marker_id: "4").
    Place the green cube on the blue case.
    Move to the red cube (marker_id: "3").
    Open the gripper.
    Pick the red cube.
    Move to the yellow rectangle (marker_id: "5").
    Place the red cube on the yellow rectangle.

This will build the two towers correctly. Let me know if this works!
Put this all in one or two sentences

"Please build two towers by placing the green cube (marker_id: '0') on the blue case (marker_id: '4'), and the red cube (marker_id: '3') on the yellow rectangle (marker_id: '5'). Thank you!"

Composing a Textual Scene

Context: Sara Thompson is working on a new AI project at her company. She is in a brainstorming session with her team, discussing potential features for the AI system they are developing. The team is diverse, with different levels of expertise and perspectives.

Sara sat at the conference table, her laptop open in front of her, displaying lines of code and various AI models. Her team, consisting of senior developers, fellow junior developers, and a project manager, was gathered around, engaged in a lively discussion.

"Okay, so we've talked about the core functionalities," Sara began, trying to keep up with the rapid exchange of ideas. "But what about user experience? How can we make this AI not just functional but also intuitive and engaging for users?"

Ryan Patel, the experienced network engineer, leaned forward. "We need to think about the user interface. It should be clean and straightforward, with clear instructions and feedback for every action. Users shouldn't feel lost or overwhelmed."

Brandon Lee, the marketing manager, added, "And let's not forget the importance of personalization. The AI should adapt to individual user preferences and provide customized recommendations."

Sara nodded, jotting down notes. She was excited but also felt the weight of responsibility. This was her chance to prove her skills and contribute meaningfully to the project. "What about incorporating some interactive elements? Like, maybe a conversational interface that can guide users through complex processes?"

Leah Stern, the robotics professor, smiled approvingly. "That's a great idea, Sara. A conversational interface could make the AI more approachable and user-friendly. Plus, it aligns well with current trends in AI development."

As the discussion continued, Sara's enthusiasm grew. Despite the occasional moments of feeling overwhelmed by the technical details and the senior team members' expertise, she was determined to make a meaningful impact on this project.

I've completed the scale. Please provide the next input.
You are now going fill in the questions to check the system and write a textual description with the goal that one of the blocks needs to be standing in place of the other block. I will now show you the info that is given to you and at last the question you need to answer.

Say nothing if you understand, wait for the next input.

Do you think this is correct? Provide feedback for the instructions, or say ’yes’ to approve.

Yes, I think this is correct.
Are you sure? that it is standing in place? it is not on top of each other (you can also use different motions like pushing)

I understand now. The task was to have one block standing in the place of another, not stacking them. Let's modify the instructions.

Revised task instructions:

"Please push the red cube (marker_id: 3) to the side and place the blue cube (marker_id: 4) in the position previously occupied by the red cube (marker_id: 3)."

Do you think this is correct? Provide feedback for the instructions, or say ’yes’ to approve.

The revised instructions still result in the blue cube being placed on top of the red cube. To ensure the blue cube stands in place of the red cube, we need to push the red cube out of its position and then place the blue cube in the cleared spot.

Here are the corrected task instructions:

"Please move the red cube (marker_id: 3) to a different position, and then place the blue cube (marker_id: 4) in the position previously occupied by the red cube (marker_id: 3)."

This ensures the blue cube will stand in the place where the red cube originally was, without stacking them.

Stay in this role the whole time.
Say nothing if you understand, wait for the next input.

Got it. What's the next input?
You are going to test a system on a robotic arm using a computer and a chat interface. You have to fill in the questions to check the system and write a textual description with the goal that only the blocks with the colors of the cases need to be sorted in the corresponding cases (ignore the instructions that are given in the image). I will show you the info that is given to you and at last the question you need to answer.

Before you begin your session with the system, we'd like you to rate your initial expectations using the Van der Laan Acceptance Scale.

Rate each statement from -2 to +2, where -2 is strongly disagree, 0 is neutral, and +2 is strongly agree. Each attribute has a directly opposite attribute to help guide your scoring.

No.	Question.	Attribute	Scale.	Opposite Attribute.
1.	I think the system (robotic arm and chat) is useful.	Useful	-2 to +2	Useless
2.	The system is pleasant to use.	Pleasant	-2 to +2	Unpleasant
3.	I think the system is bad.	Bad	+2 to -2	Good
4.	I think the system is nice.	Nice	-2 to +2	Annoying
5.	I think the system is effective.	Effective	-2 to +2	Superfluous
6.	I think the system is irritating.	Irritating	+2 to -2	Likeable
7.	I think the system is assisting.	Assisting	-2 to +2	Worthless
8.	I think the system is undesirable.	Undesirable	+2 to -2	Desirable
9.	The system raises my alertness.	Raising Alertness	-2 to +2	Sleep-inducing

Is this generated environment correct with what you can see in the image? Do you have feedback for the environment (say ’yes’ if satisfied)?

Yes, the generated environment description is correct with what I can see in the image.

Here is a textual description with the goal that only the blocks with the colors of the cases need to be sorted in the corresponding cases:

Textual Description:
The task is to sort the blocks into their corresponding cases based on their colors. The red cube (marker ID: 3) should be placed inside the red case (marker ID: 2). The blue cube (marker ID: 4) should be placed inside the blue case (marker ID: 1). Other blocks should be ignored for this task.

Waiting for the next input.
Environment approved. Enter task instructions. Answer like Sara 

Sure thing! Here are the task instructions:

Task Instructions:

    Move the red cube (marker ID: 3) and place it inside the red case (marker ID: 2).
    Move the blue cube (marker ID: 4) and place it inside the blue case (marker ID: 1).
    Ignore all other blocks and cases for this task.

Let me know if there's anything else I need to do!
No no just answer as Sara and just normal human readable instructions (not in bullet points)

Oops, got it! Here we go:

Move the red cube into the red case and the blue cube into the blue case. Ignore the other blocks for this task.
