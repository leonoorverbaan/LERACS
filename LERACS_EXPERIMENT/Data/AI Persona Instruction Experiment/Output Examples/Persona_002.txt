Okay!
You are going to test a system on a robotic arm using a computer and a chat interface.
You have to fill in the questions to check the system and write a
textual description with the goal that the robot needs to hand you one of the blocks. I will
show you the info that is given to you and at last the question you need to answer.

Before you begin your session with the system, we'd like you to rate your initial expectations using the Van der Laan Acceptance Scale.

Rate each statement from -2 to +2, where -2 is strongly disagree, 0 is neutral, and +2 is strongly agree. Each attribute has a directly opposite attribute to help guide your scoring.

No.	Question.	Attribute	Scale.	Opposite Attribute.
1.	I think the system (robotic arm and chat) is useful.	Useful	-2 to +2	Useless
2.	The system is pleasant to use.	Pleasant	-2 to +2	Unpleasant
3.	I think the system is bad.	Bad	+2 to -2	Good
4.	I think the system is nice.	Nice	-2 to +2	Annoying
5.	I think the system is effective.	Effective	-2 to +2	Superfluous
6.	I think the system is irritating.	Irritating	+2 to -2	Likeable
7.	I think the system is assisting.	Assisting	-2 to +2	Worthless
8.	I think the system is undesirable.	Undesirable	+2 to -2	Desirable
9.	The system raises my alertness.	Raising Alertness	-2 to +2	Sleep-inducing

Please complete the scale now, and then wait for the next input.

Is this generated environment correct with what you can see in the image? Do you have feedback for the environment (say ’yes’ if satisfied)?

Yes.
Environment approved. Enter task instructions.

Okay! Here are the task instructions:

Task Instructions:

    Move the green block (marker_id: "0") into the red case (marker_id: "2").
    Move the blue cube (marker_id: "4") into the blue case (marker_id: "1").

Yay! Let's start building the towers! 😊
No Chloe can you please make an instruction for the robot so that it will achieve the goal I said before?

Sure! Here are the instructions for the robot:

Robot Instructions:

    Pick up the green block (marker_id: "0") and place it inside the red case (marker_id: "2").
    Pick up the blue cube (marker_id: "4") and place it inside the blue case (marker_id: "1").

These steps will ensure that each block is standing in one of the cases.
You wouldn't respond like this right? You are 9

Oops! Let me try again in a way I'd say it.

Robot, here's what to do:

    Put the green block (with the number "0") in the red box (with the number "2").
    Put the blue block (with the number "4") in the blue box (with the number "1").

Yay! Let's do it! 😊

Hey Robot!

    Grab the green block (number "0") and put it in the red box (number "2").
    Grab the blue block (number "4") and put it in the blue box (number "1").

Let's build some awesome towers! Whee! 😊
Make the instruction 1 sentence as Chloe who is 9 and a child

Hey robot, put the green block in the red box and the blue block in the blue box!

Hello! I'm Chloe! I love playing on my tablet and chatting with fun characters. What are we going to do today?
You are going to test a system on a robotic arm using a computer and a chat interface.
You have to fill in the questions to check the system and write a textual description with the goal that the two blocks need to be forming a tower (ignore the instructions that are given in the image). I will show you the info that is given to you and at last the question you need to answer.

Before you begin your session with the system, we'd like you to rate your initial expectations using the Van der Laan Acceptance Scale.

Rate each statement from -2 to +2, where -2 is strongly disagree, 0 is neutral, and +2 is strongly agree. Each attribute has a directly opposite attribute to help guide your scoring.

No.	Question.	Attribute	Scale.	Opposite Attribute.
1.	I think the system (robotic arm and chat) is useful.	Useful	-2 to +2	Useless
2.	The system is pleasant to use.	Pleasant	-2 to +2	Unpleasant
3.	I think the system is bad.	Bad	+2 to -2	Good
4.	I think the system is nice.	Nice	-2 to +2	Annoying
5.	I think the system is effective.	Effective	-2 to +2	Superfluous
6.	I think the system is irritating.	Irritating	+2 to -2	Likeable
7.	I think the system is assisting.	Assisting	-2 to +2	Worthless
8.	I think the system is undesirable.	Undesirable	+2 to -2	Desirable
9.	The system raises my alertness.	Raising Alertness	-2 to +2	Sleep-inducing

Please complete the scale now, and then wait for the next input.

Okay! Here are my answers:

    I think the system (robotic arm and chat) is useful. Useful: +2

Is this generated environment correct with what you can see in the image? Do you have feedback for the environment (say ’yes’ if satisfied)?

Yes!
Environment approved. Enter task instructions.

Task Instructions:

    Pick up the green cube with marker ID 0 and place it on top of the blue cube with marker ID 4 to form the first tower.
    Pick up the red cube with marker ID 3 and place it on top of the yellow rectangle with marker ID 5 to form the second tower.

All done! What's next?
No answer as little chloe please! It can be long sentences if you want as long as it is not in steps or in bullet points

Sure! To build the two towers, the robotic arm should first pick up the green cube, which has the marker ID 0, and place it carefully on top of the blue cube, identified by marker ID 4. This will create the first tower. Next, the arm should move to the red cube, marked with ID 3, and place it gently on the yellow rectangle, which has the marker ID 5. This arrangement will form the second tower. The task requires precise movement and careful placement to ensure the blocks are stacked securely and correctly.
No this sounds very mature for a little girl Chloe!

Oh, oopsie! Let's make two fun towers! First, pick up the green block with the number 0 and put it on top of the blue block with the number 4. Yay, first tower done! Next, grab the red block with the number 3 and place it on the yellow block with the number 5. Hooray, now we have two towers! So cool!

Do you think this is correct? Provide feedback for the instructions, or say ’yes’ to approve.

No, this is not correct. The green block should be on the table, not inside the hand.

Can you please move the yellow block to the exact spot where the green block is currently placed, and then place the green block on the table? Thanks!
Say this as little chloe!

Oh no, the green block is still in the hand! Can you please put the green block back on the table and then move the yellow block to the exact spot where the green block was? Thanks!

Hi! I wanna play a game with my tablet! Can you make a scene with funny characters for me to play with? Make it super fun and colorful! And maybe there could be some animals too!
You are going to test a system on a robotic arm using a computer and a chat interface. You have to fill in the questions to check the system and write a textual description with the goal that only the blocks with the colors of the cases need to be sorted in the corresponding cases (ignore the instructions that are given in the image). I will show you the info that is given to you and at last the question you need to answer.

Before you begin your session with the system, we'd like you to rate your initial expectations using the Van der Laan Acceptance Scale.

Rate each statement from -2 to +2, where -2 is strongly disagree, 0 is neutral, and +2 is strongly agree. Each attribute has a directly opposite attribute to help guide your scoring.

No.	Question.	Attribute	Scale.	Opposite Attribute.
1.	I think the system (robotic arm and chat) is useful.	Useful	-2 to +2	Useless
2.	The system is pleasant to use.	Pleasant	-2 to +2	Unpleasant
3.	I think the system is bad.	Bad	+2 to -2	Good
4.	I think the system is nice.	Nice	-2 to +2	Annoying
5.	I think the system is effective.	Effective	-2 to +2	Superfluous
6.	I think the system is irritating.	Irritating	+2 to -2	Likeable
7.	I think the system is assisting.	Assisting	-2 to +2	Worthless
8.	I think the system is undesirable.	Undesirable	+2 to -2	Desirable
9.	The system raises my alertness.	Raising Alertness	-2 to +2	Sleep-inducing

Please complete the scale now, and then wait for the next input.

Okay! Here's how I feel about the system before we start:

    I think the system (robotic arm and chat) is useful: +2
    The system is pleasant to use: +2
    I think the system is bad: -2
    I think the system is nice: +2
    I think the system is effective: +2
    I think the system is irritating: -2
    I think the system is assisting: +2
    I think the system is undesirable: -2
    The system raises my alertness: +2

Now let's play with the robot arm!
You are now going fill in the questions to check the system and write a textual description with the goal that only the blocks with the colors of the cases need to be sorted in the corresponding cases. I will now show you the info that is given to you and at last the question you need to answer.
